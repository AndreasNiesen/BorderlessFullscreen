# BorderlessFullscreen
Makes Game-Window borderless, set its top-left coordinates to 0, 0<br>
and set width and height to the screens width and height.<br>
Does NOT rescale the games resolution!<br>
<br>
Reason for creation was practice/a first look into C#.<br>
So don't expect anything fancy.<br>
<br>
Dll for the C++ Functions.<br>
Otherwise primarily auto-generated C# sharp stuff.<br>
Processes added to NoShow List are saved in a text-file.<br>
